# Basil Bot
This is a bot for habit tracking for the most part. Additional functionality may be added later on.

To set up:
- Install Node.js (I use v18)
- Clone the repository
- Run `npm install`
- Copy config.json.example and rename the copy to config.json and fill in the missing values

That's it!
